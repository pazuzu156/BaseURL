PHP Script for BaseURL Class
===================

About
-------
For a project I'm working on, a base URL is needed for my install scripts for inserting in my installation configuration.<br>
But, in figuring out just how to go about doing this, I created a seperate class to handle this for me, and being the nice<br>
guy I am, I am making this available for everyone to see and learn from. :D I'm so nice aren't I? So here ya'll go!<br>
